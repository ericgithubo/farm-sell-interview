To retrieve the first 10 records from the `family` 
table in the public MySQL database provided by Rfam, 
we'll need to use a SQL query. Here's how you can do it:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM family
LIMIT 10;
```

This query selects all columns from the `family`
 table and limits the result set to the first 10 records using the 
 `LIMIT` clause.

Now, to execute this query using Apache NiFi,
 we can set up a flow with the following processors:

1. ExecuteSQL Processor**:
   a. Configure the processor to use the MySQL database connection 
   details provided (host, port, user, password, database).
   b. Set the SQL select query as `SELECT * FROM family LIMIT 10;`.

2.  ConvertRecord Processor** (optional):
   a.  If necessary, you can use this processor to convert the result 
   set into a specific format (e.g., JSON, CSV) before writing it to a file.

3. PutFile Processor**:
   a. Configure this processor to write the data to a file.
   b. Specify the directory and filename where you want to store the data.

Connect these processors in a data flow, start the flow, and Apache NiFi will
 retrieve the first 10 records from the `family` table and write them to the specified file.

Once the flow is set up and tested, you can export the Apache NiFi flow 
configuration as an XML.
